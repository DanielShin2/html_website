    <h2>Origin of food:</h2>
    
    <p>Omurice or omu-rice (オムライス, Omu-raisu) is a Japanese dish[1] consisting of an omelette made with fried rice and thin, fried scrambled eggs, usually topped with ketchup.[2][3] It is a popular dish also commonly cooked at home. Children in particular enjoy omurice. It is often featured in Japan's version of a children's meal, okosama-ranchi (お子様ランチ).</p>
    
    <h2>History: </h2>

    Omurice is said to have originated around the turn of the 20th century[4] at a western-style restaurant in Tokyo's Ginza district called Renga-tei, inspired by chakin-zushi.
    
    <h2>Variations: </h2>
    
    The dish typically consists of chikin raisu(ja) (chicken rice: rice pan-fried with ketchup and chicken) wrapped in a thin sheet of fried scrambled eggs. The ingredients flavoring the rice vary. Often, the rice is fried with various meats (but typically chicken) or vegetables, and can be flavored with beef stock, ketchup, demi-glace, white sauce or simply salt and pepper. Sometimes, rice is replaced with fried noodles (yakisoba) to make omusoba. A variant in Okinawa is omutako, consisting of an omelet over taco rice. Fried hot dog and Spam are also two popular meats to include in the dish.
