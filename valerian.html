    <h2>About:</h2>
    Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets was released on 20 July 2017 in Germany by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Germany, in the United States on 21 July by STXfilms, in France on 26 July by EuropaCorp Distribution, in China on 25 August by China Film Group, in Belgium on 26 August by Belga Films, and 27 November in United Arab Emirates by Gulf Film.[12][13] It received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized the plot and some of the casting, but praised the visuals. It grossed $225 million worldwide but, due to its high production and advertising costs, was considered a box-office bomb following its release in the United States.
