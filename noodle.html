    <h2>Origin of food:</h2>
    
    <p>Jajangmyeon (자장면) or jjajangmyeon (짜장면) is a Chinese-Korean noodle dish topped with a thick sauce made of chunjang, diced pork, and vegetables.[2] It originated in Incheon, Korea where Chinese migrant workers started making zhajiangmian (noodles served with fried bean sauce) in the late 19th century. Modifications in Korea such as a darker and sweeter sauce differentiate the Korean dish from the Chinese version. Variants of the dish use seafood, or other meats.</p>
    
    <h2>History: </h2>

    Jajangmyeon was brought to Incheon, Korea during the late nineteenth century by migrant workers from Shandong province, China.[5] At a time when both Qing and Japanese businesses were competing against each other, Jajangmyeon was offered in 1905 at Gonghwachun (공화춘; 共和春), a Chinese restaurant in Incheon Chinatown run by an immigrant from the Shandong region. The restaurant is now the Jajangmyeon Museum.[
